    <string name="new_year_congratulations">2022 struck our hearts. We cried out all the tears. All the prayers were yelled. 311 days. We have something to say about every minute. But most words are superfluous. No explanation needed. Silence is needed to hear. Pauses are needed to realize We don\'t know for sure what new 2023 will bring us. I want to wish all of us one thing – victory. And that\'s the main thing. Let this year be the year of return. The return of our people. Soldiers – to their families. Prisoners – to their homes. Immigrants – to their Ukraine. The return of our lands. And the temporarily occupied will become forever free. Return to normal life. To happy moments without curfew. To earthly joys without air alerts. The return of what has been stolen from us. The childhood of our children, the peaceful old age of our parents. May the New Year bring all it. We\'re ready to fight for it. That\'s why each of us is here. I\'m here. We\'re here. You\'re here. Everyone\'s here. We\'re all Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine! Happy New Year!</string>
